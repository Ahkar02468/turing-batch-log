# Expression and Opeartor

Simple Expression => Expresion without operator

Complex Expression => simple + operator

## Precendence and Associativity

1 + 2 + 3 * 4 / 6

Precendence

     */
     ++
Associativity

> left to right or right to left => order depends on type of operator

* 1 + 2 + 12 / 6 (step 1)
* 1 + 2 + 2 (step 2)
* 3 + 4 (step 3)
* 7 (final step)

## All of the above are called "Order of Evaluation"
